Postman Clone is a tool for testing API's that allows you to make GET and POST requests, add different query params, and view information about the request status, time, and size. The tool uses fetch to make all different API requests and a dev dependency called nodemon to bundle all different node modules into the actual JavaScript code and deploy it, providing hot module reloading and other features. Styling is done using HTML, CSS, and JS.
