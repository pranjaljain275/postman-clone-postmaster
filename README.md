* Postman is an incredible tool for testing API's, you can make GET and POST request, you can add an different query params, click send
  and its gonna give you information about the request status time and size.

* We use fetch which allow us to make all different API request, also we use dev dependancy called nodemon which bundle all our different node modules
  into our actual JavaScript code and deploy it so we can use inside our production application so we can have hot module reloading and all other nice features.

* Styling is basically done using HTML, CSS, JS.
